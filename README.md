 <h3> There are more functionalities for different kind of user logged in, such as showing the logged instructor the list of students enrolled in the course that he/she is teaching...</h3>
 
<br>

<h3> More codes can be added, for example, we can let the admin assign a username and password when a new student/instructor is added to the student/instructor list so that this student/instructor can log in his/her own page. Also, we can also make the password encrypted in db to enhance the security</h3>
